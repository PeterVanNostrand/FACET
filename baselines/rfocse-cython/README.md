This is the Cython version of RFOCSE. To use this instead of the python version rename this folder to "fastcrf" and move it to top level directory. Then move setup.py to the top level and run it to build the Cython into compiled C++. This will require running on Linux. This version is included with extensive logging to validate its equivalence with the python version. See [fastcrf](https://github.com/rrunix/libfastcrf/) on GitHub for the original Cython version.
