# FACET: Robust Counterfactual Explanation Analytics

This repository contains results, figures, sample images, and prototype code for the paper *FACET: Robust Counterfactual Explanation Analytics*, currently under review at SIGMOD 2024.

FACET (Fast Actionable Counterfactuals for Ensembles of Trees) generates a novel type of explanation which we call *counterfactual regions* for decisions made by ensembles of trees. For an instance `x` a counterfactual region `R` defines a portions of the feature space where all points `x' in R` are guaranteed to be counterfactual to `x`, e.g. if `y=f(x)=A` then `y=f(x')=B`. We design FACET to be highly performant and support a wide variety of user parameters such that explanations can be interactively personalized to meet real users needs.

## User Interface Sample Images

Sample images of the explanation visual interface used in our pilot user study can be seen below. The left is the interface for the state-of-the-art Counterfactual Example Explanations and right the interface for our novel Counterfactual Region Explanations.

## Results on Additional Datasets

Our paper includes results for FACET on five publicly available benchmark datasets. We include results for three additional datasets here: COMPAS, GLASS, and VERTEBRAL. For a listing of each dataset. For a listing of information on all datasets see [Datasets](#datasets).

## Running FACET

### Requirements

The code in this repository was developed using Python 3.8.13, [`requirements.yml`](./requirements.yml) contains a list of required packages and is formatted for use with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) a list formatted for pip. To run experiments with OCEAN, a state-of-the-art method we compare to, you will need a license for the Gurobi optimizer. Free academic licenses are available [here](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/). Setup can be done as follow

```bash
# create the anaconda environment
conda config --add channels https://conda.anaconda.org/gurobi
conda create --name facet --file requirements.txt
conda activate facet
# install solver needed for SOTA comparison method MACE
pysmt-install --z3 --confirm-agreement
# activate gurobi for SOTA comparison method OCEAN
grbgetkey <your_acadmic_license_key>
```

Executing `python main.py` with no flags will perform a simple explanation of 20 instances on the vertebral dataset using FACET and an ensemble with `T=10, Dmax=5`. Parameters not involved in any given experiment are set to the default values provided in [experiments.py](./experiments/experiments.py)

All results are output to `./results/<expr_name>.csv`. Generated explanations, all parameters used in each iteration, and a summary of results can be found at `./results/<expr_name>.csv`. Code for generating all figures from the paper are available in Jupyter Notebooks at `./figures/<expr_name>.ipynb` and should be pointed to a matching results csv file of your choice.
